1. As a user, I want to create a location-based community for my college, so that I can only find people who go to the same college as I do. 
2. As a student user looking for a tutor, I don’t want to see a tutor who has a lower review than my prefered rating, so that I only get matched with the best person for the job.
3. As a user, I want to see common interests that exist in my community, so that I can find others who share my interest.
